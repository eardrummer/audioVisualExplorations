# Audio Visual Explorations
Here is a repo for my personal audio visual projects and meanderings.
Feel free to look around.

Here are the List of projects

* Deep Dreaming on Videos
  
  This project was about the audio visual project "Sorrow" [Link to music video](https://youtu.be/4vzPDCuocqM)
  
  The visual element was created by taking samples of fixed frames of a traveling window (Window of a bus/train/plane). And performing deep dreaming on each frame of the video.
