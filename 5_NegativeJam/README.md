Negative Jam [Currently a Work in Progress]

I learnt about negative harmony and the concept of a note/interval having a polarity towards an axis from Jacob Collier,
who was quoting Ernst Levy and his "Theory of Harmony"

Inspired by the concept of negative polarities of melodies and the amazing audio visual work of Dan Tepfer, I created this.

The Negative Jam.


For every melody that you play on a midi keyboard, a negative version of the melody, reversed around a fixed axis.
(for example the axis between C and G in the circle of fifths), plays automatically after a second's delay.
This is done using PureData and the PD patch sends midi correponding to both the human and machine melodies. This can be played back in a 
digital audio work station (like Ableton). 

The melodies are visualized as leaves of Trees growing upwards while the negative version forms the roots of the tree. (Jacob Collier's analogy)
This visualization is done using p5.js

Thank you Siddharth (sid0710) for ideating with me.
